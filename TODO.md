# Next steps

- [ ] Implement basic version of advance procedure, so that we can increment the sequence number
- [ ] Write a test that fills the Sequence_Buffer
- [ ] Then write a continuous test in main.odin that sends and receives packets, just use some buffer inbetween to fake a connection
        Initially send one packet, read one, send one read one and so on. That should be fine.

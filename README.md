# Game Networking

UDP based Game Networking and Protocol project for my blog and current WIP game, based off the [Building a Game Network Protocol](https://gafferongames.com/categories/building-a-game-network-protocol/) blog series and my own blog [Skarsh Dev Blog](https://skarsh.dev).

This is still very early in development and I am still figuring core parts of the protocol and library. 
I am writing the blog posts while I figure this out.
